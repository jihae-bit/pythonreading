##Things I Already Knew
- ch.1 Traditionally, first program people write is "Hello, World!"
- ch.3 Functions can make a program smaller by eliminating repetitive code. 
- ch.5 A boolean expression is an expression that is either true or false
- ch.10 The most common way to traverse the elements of a list is with a for loop.

##New Things I've Learned
- ch.1 Program is only consisted of input, output, math, conditional execution and repetition. 
- ch.3 Dividing a long program into functions allows you to debug the parts one at a time and then assemble them into a working whole.
- ch.5 chained conditional is for when we need more then two branches of possibilities.
- ch.10 Unlike strings, lists are mutable.
